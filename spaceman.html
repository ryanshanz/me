    &emsp;Johan Renck’s Spaceman debuted at the 74th Berlinale, and I had the pleasure of attending a screening. 
    It begins tediously, with a lengthy introduction to the titular character, Jakub (Adam Sandler), on his journey
     to the Chopra Cloud, a mysterious cloud of particles and dust near Jupiter. This is followed by a far-fetched, 
     if not unbelievable, decision from his wife, Lenka (Carey Mulligan), to leave Jakub while he is traveling alone, 
     millions of miles away. The film eventually finds its footing, though, as it progresses. Jakub meets Hanus, 
     a human sized spider who may or may not be a figment of Jakub’s imagination. The two form a friendship as Hanus 
     attempts to learn from Jakub, while Jakub attempts to cure his loneliness. Hanus soon takes on the role of a 
     <i>Christmas Carol</i>-esque ghost, peering into Jakub’s memories and showing him all the ways he took Lenka for granted 
     over the years, suggesting reasons she may want to leave him. Hanus illustrates to Jakub his past selfishness. 
     In a cliché but still moving conclusion, Jakub realizes that he has spent too much time pushing her away in favor of
      his solitude and his work.

    &emsp;Renck leaves a bit too much work for the audience to understand the dynamics of Jakub and Lenka’s relationship, 
    showing only bits and pieces of instances when Jakub was not fully invested in his time with Lenka (one might call him spaced out!). 
    We get no insight into what led to Jakub’s complacency, nor do we get much in the way of a backstory or details for Lenka. 
    While one could surmise Jakub neglected his relationship for the sake of his work, we get little indication of this from the 
    flashbacks, yet Jakub seems to have nothing but contempt for his job in the present.

    &emsp;Despite these flaws, Spaceman succeeds at forming a compelling love story, thanks to the excellence of Sandler and Mulligan. 
    Paul Dano’s work as Hanus also establishes a charming duo with Jakub as he demonstrates to Jakub the errors of his ways. While Spaceman 
    might have worked better with a shorter runtime, if not as a short film, it prevails as a heartfelt story against the beautiful 
    backdrop of Jakub’s retro spaceship and the Chopra Cloud.
