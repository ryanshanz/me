    &emsp;During a year dominated by the likes of <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, <i>The Towering Inferno</i> (also starring
    Faye Dunaway), and<i> Jaws</i>, 
    one might forget about <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>, Sydney Pollack’s political thriller with Robert Redford. 
    Nearly fifty years later though, the film still manages to stand out. 
     Adapted from James Grady’s novel (and shortened by three days!), the book follows Joe Turner, code name “Condor,” 
     who works for the CIA. Despite his flashy employer, Turner is described as a “bookworm,” and works as a literary 
     analyst. Though it is difficult for Robert Redford to sell himself as a nerdy agent to the audience, his initial 
     charisma and subsequent panic keep us involved. Fight scenes are scattered throughout; however, it’s the tense 
     scenes of inaction, such as the scene in the elevator with the assassin, Joubert, or the broken pen from the 
     mailman, that engages the audiences the most. The film shares many similarities with <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, 
     perhaps acting as an influence for the film – the meeting between Turner and Kathy strongly resembles that 
     of Jason Bourne and Marie, the difference being Kathy’s kidnapping (and strange Stockholm syndrome-relationship), of course.

    &emsp;The film follows Condor as he tries to escape Joubert, without any knowledge of why he is being hunted. 
        To add to the chaos, he is unable to trust his employers, after his supervisor also tries to kill him. 
        After piecing together the puzzle, he concludes that he has accidentally revealed a rogue plot from a CIA 
        deputy director named Atwood to seize oilfields in the middle east. Upon confronting the man, Turner comes 
        face-to-face with Joubert, who predicted his visit. During a shocking twist, however, Joubert spares Turner 
        his life and kills Atwood. Joubert reveals that his job to kill Turner had been superseded by a job to kill 
        Atwood by the CIA in attempts to quiet the situation. Joubert warns Turner, however, that the CIA might soon 
        try to kill him as well. <i>Seinfeld</i> fans will recognize Joubert’s prophecy as the same one Newman gives Kramer 
        in <a href="https://youtu.be/dYhhKeNlrL0?t=78" target="_blank">"The Junk Mail"</a> after Kramer cancels his mail.

    &emsp;The film ends with a meeting between Turner and Higgins, the deputy director of the CIA’s New York division. 
        Turner senses that the meeting is a setup to have him killed, so he reveals to Higgins that he has leaked his 
        story to the press. Just before the credits roll, Higgins questions whether his revelation will actually be published.

    &emsp;Pollack’s film serves as a tense and compact espionage thriller. Despite having a number of conspiracies and plot twists, 
        it never becomes too complicated and, in a country reeling from the aftermath of Watergate, surely never strays too far 
        from reality. Though the fight scenes leave a bit to be desired (something more exciting than a strict three bullets per 
        person in the first murders would have been nice) and the relationship between Turner and Hale seems questionable, the 
        writing and performances from Redford and von Sydow are enough to lift the film up and render it an exciting and involving 
        thriller for the audience.
